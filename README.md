# JavaWeb-Online Mall

## 一、objective

Through the comprehensive application of JSP and JDBC, master the basic principles and common techniques of server-side database programming for small and medium-sized Java Web application systems, and have the basic hands-on ability to design server-side database tables and JSP page JDBC programming. Specifically, it includes:

Write Java code, be familiar with and master the use of JDBC, including the principles and common methods of Connection, Statement, PreparedStatement, and ResultSet objects; 2) Write JSP pages, be familiar with and master the application syntax and control structure of JDBC in JSP pages, master the use of JSP built-in objects and server-side debugging techniques; 3) Realize the integration and integration of server-side programming technologies such as JSP and JDBC, master routine data operations such as CRUD on single tables and associated tables, and achieve reasonable code layout, dynamic webpage presentation, and real-time interaction on server-side pages.

1. Master the entire process of Java web website design;
2. Further proficiency in Servlet technology, databases, tags, and other general Java web application technologies;
3. Master the entire Java web application architecture, directory structure, and server usage.

## 二、Requirement Analysis

On the basis of comprehensive programming experiments on the client side, combined with technologies such as JSP&JDBC, the main modules of the mall backend management system (login, product, product information, etc.) are completed to achieve dynamic data display and backend operation functions of corresponding information. This mainly includes related database design and user login functions, product list dynamic database table content list display function, shopping cart addition and backend interaction function with the database, and can be debugged using development tools for server-side code.

1. Design a comprehensive online store;
2. Account module: Provides user registration and login, considering the increase or decrease in the number of users, requiring the use of database technology;
3. Product display module: In order to increase sales volume, it is necessary to have a simple advertising function and provide detailed product parameters; To promote products, the website needs to display hot selling products, classify and search for products
4. Order Management Module and Order Details Module: Display detailed information of saved orders;
5. Shopping cart module: Add/delete products, checkout, display order information.
6. Implement a series of operations by logging in as an administrator to the backend.

## 三、Brief Introduction
This mall mainly utilizes JavaServlet technology for development, which has strong logic, scalability, and is easy to maintain. The interface design of the mall mainly utilizes CSS to beautify the storefront. Secondly, the design of this mall also utilizes JSP technology, JDBC technology, and JavaBean technology.

On the basis of the basic implementation of front-end business, the main development includes: registration, login, payment and order placement (outbound shipping), order management, product management, customer management, and other back-end businesses.
